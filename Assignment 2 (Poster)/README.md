# 📝 Reflection

After attend the industrial talk regarding PPG provided a comprehensive look at how a global manufacturing leader integrates technology to "protect and beautify the world". It was fascinating to learn that PPG, founded in 1883, now operates in 70 countries with billions in annual sales , proving that even a long-standing company must stay at the forefront of digital innovation.

From a technical perspective, I was impressed by their multi-cloud strategy and the "Connect PPG" transformation, which aims to migrate legacy systems into a unified global platform. The real-world impact of their data analytics—such as using algorithms to help ships save fuel—makes the value of IT very tangible. This experience has motivated me to sharpen my skills in areas like data modeling and cloud infrastructure. Seeing that PPG highly values its interns, with nearly 50% transitioning into full-time roles, offers a very clear and encouraging career path for students like myself.
