Visiting UTM Digital was an insightful experience that showed me how essential technology is to our campus life. Seeing the infrastructure behind our daily digital tools helped me appreciate the university's "Digital-First" approach. I realized that I need to be more proactive in developing my digital literacy to make the most of the advanced resources available. This visit was highly motivating because it encouraged me to use technology more effectively in my studies and gave me a sense of pride in being a UTM student.
