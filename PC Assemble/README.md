# 📝 Reflection

Taking part in the PC assembly lab was a great hands-on experience. Having the chance to handle real hardware and assemble a computer myself was very helpful. I get chance to disassembling the parts like the cooling fan , hard disk,  power supply and RAM. Seeing these components in real life helped me understand how they all fit together to work. This lab made me more confident in my technical skills and made learning about computer hardware much more interesting.
